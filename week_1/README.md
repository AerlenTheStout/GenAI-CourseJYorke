## Lab 1 Overview

### Generative AI: Introduction and Hands-On with Hugging Face

This lab is designed to give you practical experience with the tools and concepts you'll need to work with generative AI models. You'll be using Google Colab to run Python code, explore some basic concepts, and dive into working with pre-trained models from Hugging Face.

### Key Sections Covered:

1. **Introduction and Overview**: Get a high-level understanding of what you’ll be learning.
2. **Playing Around with Google Colab**: Familiarize yourself with the Google Colab environment.
3. **Coding in Python**: Write and run Python code in Colab.
4. **Setting Up Libraries from Hugging Face**: Install and import necessary libraries.
5. **Importing and Understanding Code**: Learn how to import and interpret code modules.
6. **Loading a Pre-trained Model**: Work with a pre-trained model using the Flan-T5 base.
7. **Tokenizing Input and Model Inference**: Tokenize text and run model inference.
8. **Outputs and Prompts**: Understand and interpret the model’s output.

### How to Use This Lab:

1. Open the `Lab1_GenAI_ShiftKey.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Follow along with the instructions and run the code cells to complete the exercises.
3. Refer to `RESOURCES.md` for additional reading and tools to deepen your understanding.
